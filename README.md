# Almondo Web Interface

The ALMONDO Web Interface is the graphical front-end of the ALMONDO platform ‚Äî a modern, intuitive web application designed to provide users with interactive access to the system‚Äôs analytical and modeling capabilities.

Built with React and optimized for scalability and responsiveness, the Web Interface allows researchers and practitioners to visualize, configure, and manage simulations and models generated by the ALMONDO backend.

It serves as the bridge between the computational core and end users, delivering an accessible environment for exploring results, running analyses, and integrating new data through a clean and efficient user experience.

üîç Key Features

- Interactive dashboard for managing and launching simulations
- Real-time data visualization of model outputs
- Configurable parameters for scenario exploration
- Seamless API integration with the ALMONDO backend
- Responsive and lightweight design for cross-device compatibility

## Usage via Docker [Recommended]
üê≥ Run the ALMONDO application with Docker Compose

To quickly start both the backend and frontend services using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This command will:

- Start all containers defined in docker-compose.yml,
- Expose the web application on http://localhost:3000 (frontend),
- Run the backend API on http://localhost:8000.

To run in detached mode (in the background):
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

To stop and remove containers:
```bash
docker compose down
```
## Local Installation

Open a new terminal window and navigate to the frontend:
```bash
cd ALMONDO-WebInterface/almondo-web-app
```
Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
Build or run the development server:

To run in development mode:
```bash
npm start
```
The web interface will be served at:
üëâ http://localhost:3000

To build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```
